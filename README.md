# Petscii_Robots_TMX_converter

Here's a very simple tool that I made to create both Map 14 (Rocket Center) and Map 16 (Power Plant) for the Sega Genesis version of Petscii Robots. It lets you convert a TMX file from Tiled Map Editor into a Petscii Robots compatible map file. 

Also keep in mind that this tool is only designed to create the map world, so you still need PET TILE (by David Murray) to enter "units" in it, but that shouldn't be difficult :)
