# Petscii-Robots-TSX-converter

Here's a tool that I used to create both Map 14 (Rocket Center) and Map 16 (Power Plant) for the Sega Genesis version of Petscii Robots. It let you convert a TSX from Tiled Map Editor into a Petscii Robots compatible map. It also comes with a Injection tool for injecting new maps (Max of 6 maps can be added), so you can play it on your Genesis (flashcart needed) :).

It's also compatible with any other version of Petscii Robots, but you may note that Genesis Tileset is different, so for example a Amiga map will work with no problems on Sega Genesis but a Genesis map may have some problems running on Amiga. But theoretically it is even possible to create a map for the Commodore PET if you respect it tileset.

Also this tool is only designed to create the map world, so you still need PET TILE (By David Murray) to insert "units" into it.
